\section*{Abstract}

Various technologies are tried out in the world of video games,
being later evolved in ways to better satisfy
the purpose of its use.

Nerd Monkeys, the company where the internship took place, is a video game developer company that has
the interest in exploring new technologies.

The first technology used in the internship was blockchain, as it was
planned in the internship proposal. For the blockchain it was essentially explored its underlying technology, its working mode, its protocols and its general and specific applications in video games.

To try out some of the concepts accumulated in the blockchain research
a server-client type program was performed. Both developed in Rust for exchanging information with the Twitter API. This program sends the information obtained from the API to a shared library. The shared library, also performed at this stage can be used by any game engine that supports an ABI for the C language.


The last project carried out was a heart beats detector for Nintendo Switch IR sensor developed in C++. This was developed to make known the hardware and software of this video games console allowing to know its development space and what can be used on it.
